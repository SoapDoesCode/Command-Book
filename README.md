# Command-Book
A custom Minecraft Java command book I am working on.

To obtain this command book you must:
1. Get a command block by running this command in your minecraft world ```/give @p minecraft:command_block```
2. Copy/Paste the book command from the ```Command_Book.txt``` file into the command block
3. Use a button, Lever, Redstone Block/Torch, etc to power the command block, this will give you a written book called ```Command Book```
